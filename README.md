Intelligent Cities (also known as CityIQ) is a Edge to Cloud Platform performing real-time computer analytics on your city streets. By obtaining client credentials you are gaining access to the text data quantifying city events related to Parking, Pedestrian, Traffic and Environmental occurances.  For more information about the platform please go to: https://developer.currentbyge.com/cityiq/

API Documentation is found at : https://docs.cityiq.io

The documents and their purpose is described here:

1. OnBoarding_CityIQ_Postman_and_FAQ.pdf : This document will be your starter guide in accessing the APIs (Application Programming Interface) and getting started using Postman. For advanced users, we recommend begining with the starter code found at: https://github.com/CityIQ/CityIQ-Starter-Code (Javascript Users) or https://github.com/CityIQ/CityIQ-Starter-Code-Python (Python Users)

NOTE: To download Postman, please use Chrome Browser and go to https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.  If you are unable to use Postman because of IT security systems, please go here (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) and add Postman App to your Chrome Browser. 

2. The OnBoarding PDF references a Postman Collection and Environment which are both predix based postman files.  Please note that two new postman files are added called NEW-CityIQ-OnBoarding-Collection-PostMigration.postman_collection.json and New-Environment-Please-Complete-Independently.postman_environmentt.json. These "new" files are replacements for the deprecated files. 

As of April 1 2019, import these two new files to your Postman App.  You will be able to view the Collection on the left hand side in the "Collections" tab and the environment will become available in the upper right hand corner drop-down. Additionally a GlobalVariables.json file is included which can be used with the Collection.  After making a request and obtaining an asset (for example) highlight and right click the asset and set Global to set it to a global variable that is referenced throughout the collection. 

NOTE: before making requests, you must insert your credentials to the environment otherwise you will not be able to make any requests.

3.  API-Technical-Training-SD-2019Jan30.pdf is former presentation used to explain the hierarchical API structure of the CityIQ APIs.  Please reference this document for additional questions.

4.  API-Maps.pdf is a collection of API CheatSheets designed to quickly enable clients to understand where the data exists in the world and via what network they need to access it.
